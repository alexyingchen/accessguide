# Introduction

## General introduction
Hello! This is a guide to help you create more accessible products and websites. As the role and capabilities of technology expand, we want to equip you with the right tools to make tech is accessible to everyone. These guidelines provide a general overview of what to do, who it’s for, and why it’s important.

## Content Creation
The Content Creation guide helps you understand how to make your content available to people with different sensory abilities. How does a blind person experience your visuals, or a deaf person your audio? Can people with different levels of reading comprehension understand your writing? For people who work with photos, videos, audio, and writing, this is a guide to help you make accessible content.

## Design
The Design guide builds on a foundation of industry best practices of usability and style to consider the needs of people who have intellectual, visual, and physical disabilities. How does someone with hand tremors use your site? Can a color blind person understand your error messages? Will someone with limited memory find your app intuitive? This is a guide specifically for people who work on visual design, information architecture, navigation, and user experience.

## Programming
The Programming guide demonstrates how to implement accessibility into the structure of apps and websites. Can a blind person navigate and read your content using a screen reader? Can someone with limited mobility complete tasks with a keyboard? Can people customize the interface if they need to zoom in to see, or need more time to complete their task? This guide provides techniques and best practices for writing accessible code.

## General outro
To get a holistic understanding of all the guidelines, we definitely recommend using the entire Access Guide set (Content Creation, Design, and Programming). We encourage you to consider this as a starting point for understanding what accessibility entails and where you can improve. For more detail on how to meet and implement these guidelines, we recommend referring to the original content we draw from - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG) - and your local a11y chapter.

# Types of disabilities
Our goal is to help you create for a diversity of people. These are the main categories of disabilities to consider for accessibility.

| Disability | Image description | Disability description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visual | Drawing of human eye | Low vision, blind, or color blind |
| Hearing | Drawing of human ear | Deaf or hard of hearing |
| Cognitive | Drawing of human brain | Affects cognitive ability, functioning, and processing |
| Learning | Drawing of open book | Difficulty processing information in reading, writing, math, etc. |
| Physical | Drawing of accessibility icon (wheelchair user) | Affects physical functioning, mobility, dexterity, or stamina |
| Speech | Drawing of human head with speech bubble | Affects production of sounds (stutter, lisp) or being mute |
| Language | Drawing of two overlapping speech bubbles | Difficulty understanding people and/or expressing one’s thoughts and emotions |

# WCAG conformance levels
Each guideline is based on a matching guideline in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG). The number (such as 3.2.4) indicates the WCAG section to help you look it up. The letters (such as AA) indicates the conformance level to help you prioritize your work. Since AA is the standard legal requirement, we recommend focusing on A and AA.

## A
Minimum baseline. Meeting level A will remove critical barriers for people who are blind, deaf, epileptic, or with motor impairments.

## AA
Standard legal requirement. Level AA includes important guidelines for people with low vision and cognitive disabilities.

## AAA
Going above and beyond. Level AAA has more strict guidelines, making it the most accessible but also most difficult to achieve.
