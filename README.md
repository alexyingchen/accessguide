# Access Guide
Access Guide is a simplified, illustrated version of WCAG 2.1 (web content accessibility guidelines). This is a repository of all written content.

## Project description
Today, the tech industry is increasingly more aware of the importance of accessibility. However, many find it difficult to achieve due to lack of time, resources, and subject matter knowledge. While industry standards like WCAG are available, they are dense, text-heavy, and difficult to understand.

Access Guide takes WCAG 2.1 and simplifies the language, provides original illustrations of tangible examples, and puts the focus on user stories so people know why and whom they’re creating for. Our goal is to make the accessibility standards themselves actually accessible to educate and motivate people who make products and websites.

Access Guide will be available as a set of 3 books as part of the Radical Visibility series by Rebirth Garments: one edition for designers, one for programmers, and one for content creators. Access Guide will also be available for free on a website and social media, minus some bonus illustrations and in-depth user stories. To ensure we’re sharing accurate information, we are working with accessibility industry experts and disability advocates.
