# Access Guide
Access Guide is a simplified, illustrated version of WCAG 2.1 (web content accessibility guidelines).

Please keep in mind that this is NOT the intended final format of the guide, but rather a repository of all written content for the purposes of:
1. Collecting feedback
2. Version control maintenance
3. Public sharing

The final version will look A LOT cooler! See the project description below for what I have planned. In the mean time, feel free to read and add feedback by logging issues.

**When you log an issue, please reference the number (e.g. C12)** so that I know which module you're referring to. I created modules to make the content more easily digestible. Each module has:
1. Number
2. Title
3. User quote
4. Description
5. Disabilities
6. WCAG number + conformance

Some modules have several WCAG numbers because sometimes there are multiple WCAG success criteria that refer to the same topic, but have different conformance levels.

As you read through the guide, please think about the following:

**How interesting is the guide?** Is the content engaging? Would I want to share this with a colleague or friend? Do I ever get bored reading this?

**How easy to understand is the guide?** Is the language simple and clear? Am I getting confused by anything?

**How relevant to my industry is the guide?** Is this using industry standard terminology? Could I discuss the guide in a meeting? Are there any words that feel odd or out of place?

## Project description
Today, the tech industry is increasingly more aware of the importance of accessibility. However, many find it difficult to achieve due to lack of time, resources, and subject matter knowledge. While industry standards like WCAG are available, they are dense, text-heavy, and difficult to understand.

Access Guide takes WCAG 2.1 and simplifies the language, provides original illustrations of tangible examples, and puts the focus on user stories so people know why and whom they’re creating for. Our goal is to make the accessibility standards themselves actually accessible to educate and motivate people who make products and websites.

Access Guide will be available as a set of 3 books as part of the Radical Visibility series by Rebirth Garments: one edition for designers, one for programmers, and one for content creators. Access Guide will also be available for free on a website and social media, minus some bonus illustrations and in-depth user stories. To ensure we’re sharing accurate information, we are working with accessibility industry experts and disability advocates.
